This is the same McKinley responsible for the McKinley Tariff, which substantially reduced the income of Hawaiʻi sugar growers from $12,159,084 in 1890 to $6,963,504 in 1892, and effectively goaded them into the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani in order to revive their profits through Annexation."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Five years after the Overthrow, during an Annexation debate in the Senate on May 31, 1898, Senator John Morgan (known for The Morgan Report) commented:"," "),r.a.createElement("blockquote",null,"“The President of the United States (McKinley) has got his mind made up that as a matter of military necessity he is obliged to take those islands and intends to do it.”"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"There was no military necessity.

It was well known by all in Congress that the newly established government, the Republic of Hawaiʻi, which was a product of the Overthrow, did not represent the will of the people. The U.S. Constitution requires a “Yes” vote by two-thirds of those present in the U.S. Senate in order to ratify a treaty of annexation. After a failed attempt to get the two-thirds vote in 1893, and two more failed attempts in June and September of 1897, McKinley pushed for Joint Resolution 259 (the Newlands Resolution) and signed it into law on July 7th, 1898. In truth, a lawful annexation never occurred because a Joint Resolution of Congress is a domestic measure, having no lawful application or authority beyond U.S. borders.

No Treaty of Annexation was ever ratified."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"When Honolulu High School moved to the corner of Beretania and Victoria Streets in 1907, the name of the school was changed to honor McKinley, an insult to the majority of the people of Hawaiʻi.

His name and statue ignore his wrongdoings which set the stage for the decimation of the Native people. This is happening in Hawaiʻi, right in the educational system that you lead.
